<!-- CHECKPOINT NOTES -->
<!--This is the new index.html-->
<!--It reads the code generated by running the webpack executable-->
<!--At this point in time in the project, every time we make a change to code, the webpack executable must be re-run-->
<!--This will generate a new main.js that includes changes-->
<!--main.js is a minified version of all of the code this project requires to run-->
<!--This is the default option yet. This is using React + webpack without configurations-->
<!--At this point, the css does not work and we are still using vanilla JS to write react components -->
