<!-- CHECKPOINT NOTES -->
<!--Remove all script tags, React CDN-->
<!--At this point, React, React-dom, webpack, and webpack-cli have all been installed and can be found in package.json-->
<!--This eliminates the need to use script tags in this file-->
<!--Since we are now using module imports, each file now imports its dependencies at the top-->
<!--For example, App.js imports React and the Header and Content components-->
<!--Now, with webpack installed, we can use the terminal to run an executable from node modules `./node_modules/.bin/webpack'`-->
<!--Running this in the command line will generate a `dist` directory, which I will not commit.-->
<!--This directory contains a main.js which is all of this project's code minified-->
<!--After running the executable, the terminal shows 'WARNING in configurations. The 'mode' option has not been set...'-->
