<!-- CHECKPOINT NOTES -->
<!--A webpack.config.js file has been created to specify a new directory for webpack output-->
<!--The config also customizes the name of the script source so this has been changed from the dafault of main.js tp bundle.js -->
<!--Webpack is now hashing bundle.js-->
<!--A new hash signals that the bundle file has a change!-->
<!--Content hashing is a cache busting strategy. The new file name forces the browser to make a request to serve the new file-->
<!--If nothing in the code changes, the hash will stay the same. This allows the browser to use the cached file-->
<!--The current setup is not efficient and it's annoying. For ecxample: -->
<!--Every time we run webpack and create a new hashed bundle file, it must be manually updated here in index.html!-->
<!--The build/dist directory is getting bloated! Every time a change is made and webpack is run, it adds a new bundle file with an updated hash-->
