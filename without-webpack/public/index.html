<!-- CHECKPOINT NOTES -->
<!--The without-webpack directory is now properly setup to render a basic application-->
<!--The index.html loads all files in the proper order. This order must be manually maintained.-->
<!--React is being loaded via CDN-->
<!--Rather than use JSX with React, we must use vanilla JS because this is what the browser can read.-->
<!--In the with-webpack project, we will use webpack and babel to transpile JSX code for us-->
<!--The components Content and Header are being rendered via App.js-->
<!--index.js is looking for the "entryPointID in index.html as the location in which to inject the React code."-->
